# 8base: Accelerate Your Development Workflow

## Introduction: 
8base is a revolutionary development platform that combines low-code efficiency with traditional coding power, enabling rapid application creation and deployment.

# Features:

- #### Visual Development:
Drag-and-drop visual development, simplifying the creation of user interfaces and workflows.

- #### Pre-built Components:
Access a library of pre-built components to accelerate development, ranging from UI elements to complex backend services.

- #### Scalable Backend:
Utilize robust backend services to manage data, authentication, and business logic, ensuring scalability and reliability.

- #### Serverless Architecture:
8base offers a serverless backend, meaning you don't have to manage server infrastructure. This can reduce operational overhead and costs.

- #### Integrated Tools:
The platform provides various integrated tools like a database, authentication, and GraphQL API, which can accelerate development without the need to integrate multiple services.

- #### GraphQL:
8base utilizes GraphQL for its API, which allows for efficient data fetching and gives developers flexibility in querying only the data they need.

- #### Security:
Built-in security features, like authentication and authorization, help in maintaining the security of your application.

# Cons

- Learning Curve: While 8base aims to simplify development, there might still be a learning curve associated with understanding the platform's concepts and tools. 

- Vendor Lock-In: Depending solely on a platform like 8base can create a level of vendor lock-in, where moving away from the platform can be challenging.

- Customization Limitations: While low-code platforms offer convenience, they might limit customization options for complex or unique requirements.

- Limited Control: For developers who prefer full control over their infrastructure and technology stack, the managed nature of 8base might be a drawback.

- Performance and Optimization: While serverless architectures can be efficient, they also require careful consideration of performance optimization and potential latency issues.

- Platform Evolution: Any platform can undergo changes over time, and these changes might affect your application. Keeping up with updates and changes in the 8base platform is important.

- Costs: While serverless architectures can save costs, they might not be the most cost-effective option in all scenarios, especially for high-traffic applications.

- And my personal favourite: Documentation is not up-to-date and writing a simple insert, inserting two fields in db took me a week (Albeit after-hours). Same code in react is ~1 hour.
